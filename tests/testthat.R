#' @srrstats {G5.2} Error and warning behaviour is tested.
#' @srrstats {G5.2a} Messages are unique.
#' @srrstats {G5.2b} Conditions are demonstrated.
#' @srrstats {G5.4, G5.4a, G5.6} Output of dosearch is compared against known 
#'   theoretical identifiability and non-identifiability results. 
#'   In other words, correctness can be tested independently of the 
#'   implementation.
#' @srrstats {G5.5} The algorithm is deterministic, so this could also be NA
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.6a} Because the package output is symbolic, the recovery
#'   of e.g., a causal effect is exact.
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.6b} *Parameter recovery tests should be run with multiple random seeds when either data simulation or the algorithm contains a random component. (When long-running, such tests may be part of an extended, rather than regular, test suite; see G4.10-4.12, below).* 
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.7} **Algorithm performance tests** *to test that implementation performs as expected as properties of data change. For instance, a test may show that parameters approach correct estimates within tolerance as data size increases, or that convergence times decrease for higher convergence thresholds.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.8} **Edge condition tests** *to test that these conditions produce expected behaviour such as clear warnings or errors when confronted with data with extreme properties including but not limited to:*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.8a} *Zero-length data*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.8b} *Data of unsupported types (e.g., character or complex numbers in for functions designed only for numeric data)*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.8c} *Data with all-`NA` fields or columns or all identical fields or columns*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.8d} *Data outside the scope of the algorithm (for example, data with more fields (columns) than observations (rows) for some regression algorithms)*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.9} **Noise susceptibility tests** *Packages should test for expected stochastic behaviour, such as through the following conditions:*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.9a} *Adding trivial noise (for example, at the scale of `.Machine$double.eps`) to data does not meaningfully change results*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.9b} *Running under different random seeds or initial conditions does not meaningfully change results* 
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.10} *Extended tests should included and run under a common framework with other tests but be switched on by flags such as as a `<MYPKG>_EXTENDED_TESTS="true"` environment variable.* - The extended tests can be then run automatically by GitHub Actions for example by adding the following to the `env` section of the workflow: 
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.11} *Where extended tests require large data sets or other assets, these should be provided for downloading and fetched as part of the testing workflow.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.11a} *When any downloads of additional data necessary for extended tests fail, the tests themselves should not fail, rather be skipped and implicitly succeed with an appropriate diagnostic message.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.12} *Any conditions necessary to run extended tests such as platform requirements, memory, expected runtime, and artefacts produced that may need manual inspection, should be described in developer documentation such as a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `tests/README.md` file.*
